# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Registered users can create short URLs for websites of their choice, then use these short URLs to access the webpages associated with their longURLs.

*This project was completed during Week 3 of Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp*
